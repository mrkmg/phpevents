phpevents is a simple trait and class to add events into PHP (5.4+).

Using phpevents is quite simple.

- Include event.php
- Use EventTemplate on each class you want to event enabled
- In each class, define event types. The easiest way is in __construct by using method _ev_set_type($type) where $type is string of the event name for each desired type.
- Bind functions to each event. They can be a global function by name, or an anonymous function. See Examples
- At anypoint, from anywhere, you can fire an event by name, and each bound function will be called with an event object.


All conceptual right now, everything is up to be changed.
